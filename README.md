Machine Learning for User Classification
This project aims to classify users based on engagement metrics using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict whether a student on our platform will upgrade from a free plan to a paid subscription. By analyzing anonymized data, including features like the number of days spent on the platform, minutes of content watched, and the number of courses started, this project provides valuable insights into user behavior and potential conversion.

🚀 Project Overview
With the increasing need to understand user engagement and predict behavior, this machine learning classification problem explores several models to identify students likely to upgrade their plans. The models implemented include:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forests
The comparison of these models will highlight which algorithm performs best in predicting user upgrades based on the given features.

🛠️ Key Features
Data Analysis: Explore and preprocess engagement metrics, understanding patterns and correlations in the data.
